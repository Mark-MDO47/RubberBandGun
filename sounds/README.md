When fired, the rubber band gun will play a sequence similar to the "soundified" rendition of two neutron stars colliding in 2017

or maybe from the two black holes colliding in 2015
https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102
or a simulation of this. We will shamelessly Hollywoodify this sound to make it ridiculously cool!


Thank you LIGO folks for making the fun sounds available to non-researchers!

I particularly like GW170817-template.wav; it has the ramp-up and then the kick at the end. Of course, I would make it just like itself but even more so!!!

Another one I like: Gravitational Waves from a Neutron Star Merger Produced a Signal Detected by LIGO
