When fired, the rubber band gun will play a sequence similar to the "soundified" rendition of two neutron stars colliding in 2017

- https://qz.com/1103444/ligo-listen-to-a-kilonova-the-sound-of-two-stars-colliding-in-space/

... or maybe from the two black holes colliding in 2015

- https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102

or a simulation of this. I will shamelessly Hollywoodify this sound to make it ridiculously cool!


Thank you LIGO folks for making the fun sounds available to non-researchers!

A very readable one-page comparison of gravity waves to light and sound wave perception is here:
- http://gmunu.mit.edu/sounds/sounds.html

Here are some good articles and overview of LIGO and gravity waves:
- https://www.ligo.org/index.php
- https://www.ligo.org/detections/O1O2catalog.php
- https://www.gw-openscience.org/audiogwtc1/

I particularly like GW170817-template.wav; it has the ramp-up and then the kick at the end, which can be found at https://www.gw-openscience.org/audiogwtc1/. Of course, I would make it just like itself but even more so!!!

Here is where you can get audio from the Cassini mission representing radio emissions from Saturn:

The Rubber Band Gun speaks to you when you want to configure the sounds or LED patterns. 
I used the "original" eSpeak text-to-speak program version 1.48.04. This produces sounds with a robotic flavor, which I wanted.

The original eSpeak text to speech code and compiled versions can be found at http://espeak.sourceforge.net/
- Kudos to (email) jonsd at users dot sourceforge dot net for creating eSpeak

Note that eSpeak project is inactive since disappearance of Jonathan Duddington.

Active development and support now happens in eSpeak NG project https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng, maintained by Reece H. Dunn.
- Kudos to Reece H. Dunn for continuing the good work

A web implementation of eSpeak can be found as below; it is great fun, and just one of many text-to-text and text-to-speech engines on the site. https://lingojam.com/RobotVoiceGenerator
