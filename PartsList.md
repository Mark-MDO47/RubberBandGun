Total cost (without wood or 3D printer parts or wire) $144.38
- but about $36 of that cost is the bluetooth speaker which you may have or not need

The barrel of the Rubber Band Gun is made from wood, with a sliding barrel attachment to assist in stringing the rubber band through the LED rings. The rest including the handgrip is 3-D printed. The clear cover for the handgrip is laser-cut acrylic; there is another acrylic board inside.

# Audio Player Part
The YX5200 uses FAT32-formatted TF or microSD card up to 32 GByte

These look like a helpful sites for the YX5200:
* https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299
* https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobotDFPlayerMini

This one is a re-write of the DFRobot library; also includes an English language spec sheet in the "extras" directory.

For a description of my experiences with using this module (I had some challenges), see the Readme.md in https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/RubberBandGun/tree/master/RBG_arduino.

# Bluetooth Transmitter Part
The KCX_BT_EMITTER Bluetooth Audio Transmitter Module receives line-level (not speaker-level) stereo audio in and transmits to a Bluetooth receiver (speaker, headphones, etc.). Be sure to connect the analog ground and do not connect analog ground to digital ground. Also due to latency in packetizing/depacketizing the Bluetooth audio, it is best to turn off the built-in speaker on the RBG if using the Bluetooth audio.

The Bluetooth Module uses an "AT" command set to program it to connect to your speaker and not others. Included in this repository is an Arduino sketch for a 2nd Arduino that is used to program the KCX_BT_EMITTER in-place. The following document describes using this capability:
