# RubberBandGun
A high-tech imagining of the rubber band gun

Keith and Jim and I are working on a Science-Fiction Rubber Band Gun!

It will have four rings of WS2812b 5050 RGB LED Ring proceeding up the barrel, each one larger than the previous in a "blunderbuss" shape.

When fired, it will play a sequence similar to the "soundified" rendition of two neutron stars colliding in 2017

or maybe from the two black holes colliding in 2015

or a simulation of this. We will shamelessly Hollywoodify this sound to make it ridiculously cool!

At the same time as the sound, the LED rings will be doing trippy patterns to make it look like they are being charged up followed by a sequential pulsing that would convince anyone who knows absolutely less than nothing about such things that a rail-gun effect is propelling the rubber band down the central tube.

# Parts List
We are still in the design stages but expect to use these parts or similar:
- 1 @ clothespin in homage to rubber band guns everywhere
- 2 @ V3.0 ATmega328P 5V 16M CH340 Compatible to Arduino Nano V3 with 32Kbyte Flash (program storage), 2Kbyte SRAM, 1Kbyte EEPROM: ***source TBS***
- 1 @ UBEC 3Amp: ***source TBS***
- 2 @ sets of LED rings: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07437X7SL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- 2 @ Button top 18650 Rechargeable Batteries: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VGC84Q6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

The body of the Rubber Band Gun is expected to be made from wood, with a sliding barrel attachment to assist in stringing the rubber band through the LED rings.

# Other Parts
We will use a USB programmer for the WT588D 8mByte sound player: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M9E4377/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
